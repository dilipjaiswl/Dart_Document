Dart
22 oct 2024
-> Dart is a client-optimized language for developing fast apps on any platform. 
-> Its goal is to offer the most productive programming language for multi-platform development.
-> paired with a flexible execution runtime platform for app frameworks.
-> Dart is designed for a technical envelope that is particularly suited to client development, 
    prioritizing both development (sub-second stateful hot reload) and high-quality production experiences
    across a wide variety of compilation targets (web, mobile, and desktop).
-> Dart also forms the foundation of Flutter. Dart provides the language and runtimes that power Flutter apps,
    but Dart also supports many core developer tasks like formatting, analyzing, and testing code.

Dart: The language
-> The Dart language is type safe; 
-> it uses static type checking to ensure that a variable's value always matches the variable's static type.
   ---Sometimes, this is referred to as sound typing.
-> Although types are mandatory, type annotations are optional because of type inference.
-> The Dart typing system is also flexible, allowing the use of a dynamic type combined with runtime checks,
-> Dart has built-in sound null safety.
-> This means values can't be null unless you say they can be. With sound null safety, 
    Dart can protect you from null exceptions at runtime through static code analysis 

Dart: The platforms
-> Native platform:
 For apps targeting mobile and desktop devices,
     Dart includes both a Dart VM with
-> just-in-time (JIT) compilation and an 
-> ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler for producing machine code.

Web platform: 
-> For apps targeting the web, Dart can compile for development or production purposes. 
-> Its web compilers translate Dart into JavaScript or WebAssembly.

Variable
-> var name = 'Bob';
-> Variables store references.
-> The variable called name contains a reference to a String object with a value of "Bob".

-> The type of the name variable is inferred to be String, but you can change that type by specifying it.
 If an object isn't restricted to a single type, specify the Object type (or dynamic if necessary).


Variable like,
var 
const = It is a runtime constant
final = it is a compile time constant.it set once only.
int =
double

Sound null Safety basic
